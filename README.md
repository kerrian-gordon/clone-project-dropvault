The upload feature is where both file selection and drag and drop will live. The API's upload module will validate incoming files, while the storage service will save their bytes. File metadata belongs in `files`; generated representations belong in `previews`. The viewer can choose a suitable display for images, PDFs, text, audio, video, and other supported formats, with download available for files that cannot be previewed.

The directories contain `.gitkeep` files so the structure is visible in Git. No framework, database, storage provider, or file type allowlist has been chosen yet.
